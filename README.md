# Reddit Background Fetcher (Alfred Workflow & Cron Script)

Alfred workflow that fetches desktop backgrounds from subreddits. I wrote this script years ago, but never thought to post it to GitHub. I may revisit this script and convert the PHP to Python at a future date.

The script uses the Reddit's JSON API (yesâ€”it still works) to download images based on the options set by the user. To avoid downloading the same image twice, the unique file name of each image is stored in a file called `cache.txt`, which is checked before an image is downloaded. Each instance that the script successfully runs will also log the timestamp to the file `log.txt`.

For the most optimal workflow, set your Wallpaper directory to where the images download and set to randomly Auto-Rotate.

**Developer note**: Usually I would not commit `.png` images to a repository, but I am doing it here for a pleasent experience with `icon.png` in the Alfred prompt.

## With Alfred

### Installation

- Download repository.
- Go to Alfred preferences.
- Click on _Workflows_.
- Create a new blank workflow.
- Right-click workflow; select _Open in Finder_.
- Place files from downloaded repository into the opened directory.

### Usage

- Trigger the Alfred prompt (`CMD + Space` _by default_)
- Type `bg` to reveal `Fetch backgrounds` and `Clear cache`.
  - `Fetch backgrounds` will run the script and download backgrounds based on your options.
  - `Clear cache` will, believe it or not, clear the cache of previously downloaded file names.

### Configuration

- Go to Alfred preferences.
- Click on the _Reddit Background Fetcher_ workflow.
- Double-click on the _Run Script_ node (to the right of the _bg_ keyword).
- Refer to the _Options_ section below for a description of each option.

## Without Alfred (Cron)

### Installation

- Download repository.
- Place the downloaded repository folder somewhere that you can reference.
  - _Example_: `~/Documents/fetcher`.
- Open `bg-cron.php` in a text editor to change the script options; refer to the _Options_ section below for a description of each option.
- Open _Terminal.app_.
- Type `crontab -e`.
- Enter when you would like the script to run, followed by the path to the file `bg-cron.php` in the respository folder.
  - For `crontab` references, visit [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/)
  - _Example_: `0 5 * * * ~/Documents/fetcher/bg-cron.php` would run the script every day at 5AM.
